# Alertmanager Webhook Logger

Generates (structured) log messages from [Prometheus AlertManager](https://prometheus.io) webhook notifier.

## Rationale

The [Prometheus Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) does not provide any history of alerts. Logging of alerts is the most simple solution to get that history. In combination with log management solutions like [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/products/), etc. it should fit most use-cases for a comfortable history of alerts.

## Usage

Command line flags:

    ./alertmanager-webhook-logger -h
